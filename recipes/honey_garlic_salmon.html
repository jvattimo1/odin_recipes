        <li>4 wild caught salmon fillets about 1/2 pound or 250 grams each, skin off or on</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika (mild, sweet or smokey)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or minced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice, (plus extra to serve)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges to serve</li>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange oven shelf to the middle of your oven. Preheat oven to broil/grill settings on medium heat. </li>
        <li>Season salmon with salt, pepper and paprika. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, until fragrant. Pour in the honey, water and soy sauce; allow the flavours to heat through and combine. Add in the lemon juice; stir well to combine all of the flavours together.</li>
        <li>Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan; cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden, while basting the tops with the pan juices. Season with salt and pepper, to taste (if desired).</li>
        <li>Optional -- Add the lemon wedges around the salmon (adds a stronger lemon taste).</li>
        <li>Baste salmon one more time then transfer the pan to your oven to broil / grill for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred, and the salmon is cooked to your liking.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.</li>
